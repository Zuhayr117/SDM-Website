<section id="about">
  <h2 class="fade-text"> About Us</h2>
      <p class="fade-text"> Formula SAE located at Arizona State University, Tempe campus, was formed to give students of all majors the ability to use their classroom theory in a real-world application. This multidisciplinary organization is run like a small business in order to annually create a Formula-style race car with the purpose of competing at the annual Formula Student competition in Brooklyn, MI.</p>
        <p> The premise of the competition is to build a prototype that could be purchased by amateur sports car drivers for national autocross events. In return for the member’s hard work, the organization provides opportunities to gain greater insight into the engineering profession by sponsoring meetings that bring practicing engineers to the campus, arranging field trips to engineering establishments, participating in regional SAE Chapter activities, developing business presentations to imitate pitches for earning investment capital to mass produce the car and by engaging in off-campus events to promote team building. SAE International, initially established as the Society of Automotive Engineers, is a U.S.-based, globally active professional and standards organization for engineering professionals in various industries.</p>

        <p>Our team has been hard at work every single day since the 2023 competition ended to design, plan, and manufacture our brand new 2024 car. Thousands of hours have been put into the car each year by our student members out of pure love for automotive engineering. Your support will help us finance completion of the car as well as help us transport the team and the car to the May 2024 competition in Brooklyn, Michigan.
